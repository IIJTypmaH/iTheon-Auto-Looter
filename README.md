# iTheon-Auto-Looter
Mod for Stalker Anomaly that adds the fully configurable (MCM config) auto-looting feature.
For now it has two hard requirements:
1. https://github.com/lTheon/iTheon-Pick-Best-Disassembly-Tool
2. https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/weapon-parts-overhaul

It was tested only in Stalker GAMMA environment, so I don't give you any guarantee that it will work in vanilla Anomaly
